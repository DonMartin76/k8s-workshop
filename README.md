Material for a Kubernetes Workshop

## Creating an `env.sh`

Create a `env.sh` from the [template file](env.sh.template) at the root of this repository and fill in the information needed (Service Principal credentials and so on). The data you need for the first section should have been mailed to you prior to the workshop; if not, contact one of the organizers.

## Further prerequisites

Check the following prerequisites:

* [Installed Azure Command Line 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* A usable bash console, e.g. "Terminal" on macOS, "git bash" (if you're still on Win7) or ["Ubuntu bash" for Windows 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/install_guide).
* An ssh identity in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
* An `openssl` installation (check whether `openssl` in bash gives you a prompt, otherwise install it)
* A GitHub account
