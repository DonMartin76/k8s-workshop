# Configuring the rest of the application

## Obtain Github credentials for login

To make the login to the application and the API portal work using GitHub credentials, we need to obtain client credentials for GitHub. To make this a little easier, call the following script which will tell you which applications and callback URLs you need to configure:

```
~/Projects/k8s-workshop$ ./04-full-app/github/get-github-data.sh

```
